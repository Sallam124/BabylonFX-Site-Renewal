# BabylonFX Website Renewal

This repository contains the redesigned version of the **BabylonFX** website — a money exchange shop based in Canada. The goal of this project is to improve the website’s clarity, usability, and visual appeal to better serve both new and returning customers.

## 📌 Purpose

The current BabylonFX website provides essential information, but it may not be immediately clear to new visitors what the service offers. Navigation, content layout, and real-time functionality can be improved.

This project aims to make BabylonFX more **user-friendly**, **visually clear**, and **functionally rich**, using modern web development tools.
