# BabylonFX Website Renewal

This repository contains the redesigned version of the **BabylonFX** website — a money exchange shop based in Canada. The goal of this project is to improve the website's clarity, usability, and visual appeal to better serve both new and returning customers.

## 📌 Purpose

The existing BabylonFX website provides essential information, but it may not be immediately clear to new visitors what the service offers. Navigation and content presentation can be improved, and there's no real-time data integration for exchange rates.

We're rebuilding the site to make it more **user-friendly**, **visually clear**, and **functionally rich**, using modern tools that are quick to learn and implement.

## ✅ Our Goals

- Deliver a **cleaner and more appealing design**
- Make it **immediately clear** that BabylonFX offers currency exchange services
- Improve **ease of navigation** and content structure
- Add **real-time exchange rate updates**
- Ensure the site is fully **responsive across devices**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Next.js** – modern React framework for building fast, responsive sites with built-in routing and backend support  
- **CSS Modules** – for scoped, maintainable styling  
- **Firebase** – used for real-time data and simple hosting  
- **Fetch API** – to get live exchange rate data from Firebase or external sources  
- **Vercel** – to deploy the project quickly with minimal setup

This renewal is focused on delivering a smoother, clearer experience using straightforward tools that are easy to pick up and practical for real-world projects. The new BabylonFX site will be fast, responsive, and powered by real-time updates.
