# BabylonFX Website Renewal

This repository contains the redesigned version of the **BabylonFX** website ‚Äî a money exchange shop based in Canada. The goal of this project is to improve the website's clarity, usability, and visual appeal to better serve both new and returning customers.

## üìå Purpose

The existing BabylonFX website provides essential information, but it may not be immediately clear to new visitors what the service offers. Navigation and content presentation can be improved, and there's no real-time data integration for exchange rates.

We're rebuilding the site to make it more user-friendly, visually clear, and functionally rich.

## ‚úÖ Our Goals

- Deliver a **cleaner and more appealing design**
- Make it **immediately clear** that BabylonFX offers currency exchange services
- Improve **ease of navigation** and content structure
- Add **real-time exchange rate updates**
- Ensure the site is fully **responsive across devices**

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Currently planned:
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**

Possible additions:
- **Firebase** (for real-time data and hosting)
- **Axios / Fetch API** (for handling data updates)
- **Chart.js** or similar (for simple visual representation of rates, if needed)

This renewal is focused on creating a smoother, more intuitive user experience and setting a solid foundation for future improvements.
